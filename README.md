# Danielle Williams Portfolio

## Hi, my name is Danielle Williams but I go by Ellie!

I am currently pursuing a combined Chemical Engineering and Computer Science Bachelor's Degree along with minors in Civil Engineering and Creative Coding from Northeastern University (Expected Graduation Date: May, 2027). 

I have had diverse experiencess spanning from machine learning, energy markets, environmental compliance, academic research, and dynamic team leadership. Proficient in Python, Java, SQL, MATLAB, AutoCAD, and more, I combine engineering acumen with computational skills whenever I approach a new challenge and opportunity. I also possess certifications for MS Office Specialist in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. 

One of the privilages of attending Northeastern University is access to the immersive experiential program called "Co-op" which allows students to work full-time in a professional role to gain positional experience. I have worked in two impactful roles so far, one in 2024 and another in 2025, and <b>currently searching for my third and last co-op position.
