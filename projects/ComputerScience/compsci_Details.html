            <h3>NomNetwork Project</h3>
            <p>Our demo app merges the visual excitement of Instagram with the detailed insights of Yelp. To create this, my team tied together our realistic data generation, the development of our  REST API, and the implementation of a set of user interface screens in Streamlit to create a usable end-result application.</p>

            <h3>Concentration Game</h3>
            <p>Concentration is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down. At each turn, two cards are flipped over. The object of the game is to find pairs of matching cards. In this version, there is only one player. This was created using java and Big Bang.</p>

            <h3>Drawing Machine</h3>
            <p>This project's purpose was to form a true human-machine collaboration. The user has somewhat artistic control as they draw but the computer randomly errases work forcing an abstract outcome. Th user is free drawing with colors, shapes, and thicknesses while the computer alters the drawing with its own random shapes, directions, and durations.</p>

            <h3>Creating Your Own Pixel</h3>
            <p>This project's purpose was creating flexible code that allows a select group of photos to be used in the creation of a larger image. For example: taking pictures from an artist to make their portrait or taking photos from a trip to make a group photo.
