    <h2>About the Experience</h2>
    <p>
    The Ars Electronica Futurelab Academy, located in Linz, Austria, hosts a yearly workshop where a set of Northeastern students are invited to work on projects that playfully address serious topics. These projects revolve around the Ars Electronica Ecosystem: a 5000-square-meter glass skin that consists of 1100 glass panels, where each panel is equipped with an LED bar that allows it to change its color and act as a giant, controllable display. This workshop allows students to have the opportunity to directly collaborate with Future Lab engineers to coordinate concurrent development and testing pipelines, ensuring system stability and high-impact public presentation.

    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
    Color Quandary is an interactive color competition that engages viewers to vote with their feet for their favoriet colors, creating a playful atmosphere on the main deck of the Ars Electronica Center. 
    </p>
    <p>
    At the start of each competition, the Ars Electronica facade divides into two colors. Players in the plaza are tracked using motion detection software and move towards the side with their favorite color to weigh in on their preference. The winning color overtakes the entire building. A game of Color Quandary includes seven individual round: four quarterfinal rounds, two semifinal rounds, and one final round. After a winner is crowned, the entire facade transforms into a display indicative of the overall standings of each color. This allows there to be a variety of possible end results.
    </p>
    <p>
    Color Quandary is inspired by "this or that" games in which users are asked to make a quick decision about which option they prefer. Though the idea was simplifed to translate better on the Ars Electronica facade, the heart of the idea is the same. Color Quandary invites passerby to use their bodies to control the facade with an accessible, easy to understand and visually interesting game.
