        <h2>Description of My Impact</h2>
        <p>During my co-op at UniFirst Corporation, I worked to enhance environmental compliance across all 260 locations by developing and maintaining a centralized tracker that streamlined data access for the entire environmental team. I reviewed daily maintenance logs, dissolved air flotation records, and wastewater lab reports, compiling monthly, quarterly, and semi-annual summaries while also supporting permit applications and surveys. My role included hands-on plant visits, where I recalibrated pH meters, toured wastewater facilities, and collaborated with plant managers to identify opportunities for process improvements. I also prepared and presented detailed reports, charts, and permit analyses in meetings aimed at optimizing wastewater quality, combining technical precision with actionable insights.</p>
        <p>As the only co-op within a four person team, it was critical to remain easily adaptable and complete tasks as quickly and efficiently as possible. During my time in this position, I gained very valuable skills in organization and synchronously juggling a large amount of projects with little oversight or isntruction from my suprevisor. </p>
