    <h2>My Impact</h2>
    <p>During my time working in energy analytics, I developed a strong foundation in power markets and regional ISOs while contributing to projects that blended data science with real-world impact. I explored supervised, unsupervised, and computer vision-based anomaly detection methods, ultimately designing a proof of concept that I presented to stakeholders as a pathway toward workflow optimization.</p>
    <p>Alongside this, I collaborated on building and monitoring large-scale machine learning models to boost product performance and deliver predictive insights. To expand data coverage, I designed SQL queries that successfully linked anonymized ISO bid data with known generators, overcoming limitations in source information. I also analyzed backend systems to resolve customer-reported issues—strengthening data integrity and client trust in the platform.</p>
    <p>Co-ops were given active roles and frequently recruited for cross-team projects, allowing me to engage in multiple facets of Wood Mackenzie’s products and services. This kept me constantly challenged while gaining knowledge beyond my core responsibilities.</p>
