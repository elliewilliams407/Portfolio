        <h2>Description of My Impact</h2>
        <p>During my time working in energy analytics, I developed a strong foundation in power markets and regional ISOs while contributing to projects that blended data science with real-world impact. I explored supervised, unsupervised, and computer vision-based anomaly detection methods, ultimately designing a proof of concept that I presented to stakeholders as a pathway toward workflow optimization. Alongside this, I collaborated on building and monitoring large-scale machine learning models to boost product performance and deliver predictive insights. To expand data coverage, I designed SQL queries that successfully linked anonymized ISO bid data with known generators, overcoming limitations in source information. I also took an active role in troubleshooting, analyzing backend systems to resolve customer-reported issuesâ€”work that strengthened data integrity and helped maintain client trust in the platform.</p>
        <p>Co-ops were given a very active role. We were often requested by other teams to be recruited on a task or project which allowed us to experience and engage in many facets of the products and services offered by Wood Mackenzie. This allowed me to stay constantly busy and gain knowledge in other areas outside of my job description.</p>
