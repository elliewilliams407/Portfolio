        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, my name is Danielle Williams but I go by Ellie!

            I am currently pursuing a Chemical Engineering and Computer Science Bachelor's Degree along with minors in Civil Engineering and Creative Coding from Northeastern University (Expected Graduation Date: May, 2027).
            
            I have had diverse experiencess spanning from environmental compliance, academic research, and dynamic team leadership. I recently contributed to UniFirst Corporation as an Environmental Compliance Co-op, where she streamlined compliance tracking processes for over 260 locations, prepared detailed analytical reports, and collaborated on wastewater quality improvements. My international experience includes participating in the Textiles and Coding Dialogue in Austria, where I programmed interactive public displays, blending technical innovation with creative design.
            
            My technical toolkit includes expertise in Python, Java, SQL, MATLAB, AutoCAD, and more. I also possess certifications for MS Office Specialist in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.</p>
