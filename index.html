        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, World! My name is <b>Danielle Williams</b>, but I go by <b>Ellie</b>!

            I am currently pursuing a combined Chemical Engineering and Computer Science Bachelor's Degrees along with minors in Civil Engineering and Creative Coding from Northeastern University (Expected Graduation Date: May, 2027). </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            I have diverse experiences including machine learning, energy markets, environmental compliance, academic research, and dynamic team leadership. Proficient in Python, Java, SQL, MATLAB, AutoCAD, and more, I combine engineering acumen with computational skills whenever I approach a new challenge and opportunity. I am all MS Office Specialist certified in Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            One of the privileges of attending Northeastern University is access to an immersive experiential "Co-op" program which allows students to gain positional experience working full time for a semester. I have worked in two impactful roles so far, one in 2024 and another in 2025, and <b>currently searching for my third and last co-op position for Spring 2026</b>. </p>
